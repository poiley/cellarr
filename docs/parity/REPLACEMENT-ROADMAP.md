# Replacing Sonarr + Radarr with cellarr — the complete roadmap

**Goal:** a user removes Sonarr **and** Radarr from their stack, points everything (Prowlarr,
download clients, Overseerr/Jellyseerr, Bazarr, Recyclarr, notifications, dashboards) at **one**
cellarr instance, and sees **no regression**.

This roadmap is grounded in: the measured parser oracle ([PARITY_REPORT.md](PARITY_REPORT.md)), the
`/api/v3` ecosystem probe ([api-v3-gaps.md](api-v3-gaps.md)), the quality-vocabulary diff
([quality-vocab.md](quality-vocab.md)), the decision-engine assessment
([decision-gaps.md](decision-gaps.md)), and a full functional + ecosystem inventory of the originals.

---

## 1. Definition of "drop-in" (the bar)
A drop-in replacement must satisfy, with no regression:
1. The `/api/v3` surface the ecosystem calls (Tiers 1–4 in [api-v3-gaps.md](api-v3-gaps.md)), both
   auth modes, the `X-Application-Version` header, and the paging envelope.
2. Real **indexer execution** (Torznab/Newznab search + RSS) so Prowlarr-pushed indexers work.
3. Real **download-client** integration (qBittorrent/SABnzbd min) with categories + completed-download
   handling + remote-path mappings.
4. **Import** with hardlink→atomic-move→copy semantics and same-filesystem detection.
5. **Quality + custom-format scoring** with correct precedence (quality → revision → CF score).
6. **Library state correctness** (`hasFile`/`monitored`/availability) so Overseerr marks items available.
7. **Metadata** identity (series/movie lookup + add) — the one piece gated on external licensing.
8. **Webhook/Connect** push (`eventType` + `Test`) for Bazarr-push/Notifiarr/notifications.

---

## 2. Current state (what cellarr already has)
- **Engine, built & green:** unified core, parser, decision engine, SQLite persistence, file-ops
  (stage→verify→commit→log), jobs/pipeline (real discover→import e2e test), migrate (Radarr+Sonarr
  SQLite import), API skeleton, SRCL UI. `just ci` passes (cargo 311 + web 92).
- **Parser parity: 90% exact** vs the live originals; mechanical gaps closed; the rest catalogued.
- **Decision logic:** precedence + CF condition semantics implemented + unit-tested; TRaSH import
  present. CF-score **not yet oracle-measured** against the apps.
- **`/api/v3` shim:** ~5 real GET endpoints + lookup/add/command — a thin slice of the ~25 needed.
- **Integrations:** indexer (Torznab/Newznab + Cardigann engine) and download-client (qBit/SAB/NZBGet)
  adapters exist with **record/replay fixtures**, but are **not wired into the live `/api/v3`** or
  end-to-end against real services yet.

## 4. Phased roadmap to drop-in

Ordered so each phase unlocks a real chunk of the ecosystem. Each phase has an **exit gate** that is
an oracle/contract test, not a vibe.

### Phase A — `/api/v3` ecosystem core (the biggest unlock)
The thin shim is the #1 blocker. Make unknown `/api/v3/*` return **404 JSON** (fix bug B1), then
implement, mapping existing cellarr domain data:
- `system/status` full fields + **`X-Application-Version` header** + version identity decision.
- `GET /series` and `GET /movie` (list), with accurate `path`/`*File.path`/`rootFolderPath`.
- `rootfolder`, `tag`, `health`, `qualitydefinition`, `wanted/missing`, `GET /command`.
- `qualityprofile` + **`formatItems[]`** + `/qualityprofile/schema`; `customformat` CRUD + `/schema`.
- Honor both auth modes when a key is set; full paging envelope.
- **Exit gate:** a contract suite diffs cellarr's `/api/v3` responses against recorded Sonarr/Radarr
  responses for every Tier 1–4 endpoint; Overseerr + Bazarr + a dashboard run green against cellarr.

### Phase B — Quality vocabulary + CF-score oracle (Recyclarr unlock)
- Add `Bluray-576p`, `Raw-HD`, movie pre-retail tiers; per-app remux naming in the shim.
- Build the **CF-matching + CF-score oracle**: import a real TRaSH set into Sonarr/Radarr **and**
  cellarr, diff matched-CF sets and scores over the corpus (decision-gaps.md).
- **Exit gate:** Recyclarr syncs a TRaSH config into cellarr without error; CF-score parity ≥ target.

### Phase C — Indexers live (Prowlarr unlock)
- Wire the indexer adapter to `/api/v3/indexer` CRUD + `indexer/schema` + `indexer/test` +
  `?forceSave=true`; execute real Torznab/Newznab search + RSS from the pipeline.
- **Exit gate:** Prowlarr FullSync round-trips (create/update/delete) and a search returns releases.

### Phase D — Download + import live (end-to-end acquisition)
- Wire download-client adapters live (categories, CDH, remote-path mappings); run the full pipeline
  against a real qBittorrent/SABnzbd; add **same-filesystem `st_dev` detection + health warning**.
- **Exit gate:** a real release goes search → grab → download → import → renamed-on-disk against a
  live client, with correct hardlink behavior and a health alert when `/downloads` and library differ.

### Phase E — Metadata / identify (the licensing fork)
- Wire TMDb (movies) live; for TV pick a path for TheTVDB v4 (licensed proxy / per-user PIN / run our
  own Skyhook-equivalent / lead with TMDb-TV or TVmaze). Run the **identify oracle** with populated
  libraries (compare matched IDs).
- **Exit gate:** lookup/add via Overseerr resolves to correct IDs; identify parity measured.
- ⚠️ **Hard dependency:** TheTVDB v4 has no free per-user keys. Decision required (see §6).

### Phase F — Connect webhooks + lists + calendar polish
- `eventType` webhook + `Test` event (Bazarr-push/Notifiarr/notifications); iCal feed; import lists
  (with the **empty-vs-failed-fetch** safeguard so a failed list never wipes the library); blocklist.
- **Exit gate:** Bazarr (push), Notifiarr, and a Trakt/TMDb list run green; failed-fetch leaves library intact.

### Phase G — Hardening to "feature complete"
- Full naming-token + multi-episode-style coverage; durable release-type state (no re-grab loops);
  anime depth (XEM/AniDB wiring + corpus); timezone-correct daily; performance.
- **Exit gate:** the original definition-of-feature-complete (00-vision.md) + parity thresholds met.

---

## 5. Drop-in readiness checklist (by tool)
- [ ] **Prowlarr** — `system/status`+version header, `indexer` CRUD + schema + test + forceSave (Phase A,C)
- [ ] **Overseerr / Jellyseerr** — `system/status`, `GET/POST series`+`movie`, `*/lookup`, `qualityprofile`, `rootfolder`, `tag`, `POST command`, `languageprofile`(Sonarr path), availability state (Phase A,E)
- [ ] **Bazarr** — `GET series`/`episode`/`movie` with accurate paths; optional `Download`/`Rename` webhook (Phase A,F)
- [ ] **Recyclarr / Configarr** — `customformat`(+schema), `qualityprofile`(+schema,formatItems), `qualitydefinition`, vocab alignment (Phase A,B)
- [ ] **Notifiarr** — poll endpoints + `eventType` webhook + `Test` (Phase A,F)
- [ ] **Dashboards (Homepage/Homarr)** — `wanted/missing`, `queue`, `calendar`, counts via `totalRecords` (Phase A)
- [ ] **Download clients** — live qBit/SAB with categories + CDH (Phase D)
- [ ] **Notifications** — Connect webhook + common connectors (Phase F)

---

## 6. Hard dependencies, risks, and deliberate differentiators
- **TheTVDB v4 licensing (blocker for TV metadata):** no free per-user keys; the originals hide this
  behind Servarr's Skyhook proxy. cellarr must choose: (a) a licensed contract, (b) per-user
  subscription+PIN, (c) run our own caching proxy (`cellarr-meta` standalone), or (d) lead with TMDb
  for TV / TVmaze. **This decision blocks Phase E and should be made early.**
- **The decision behavior is emergent, not declarative** — port behavior from the originals' named
  source files where exact compatibility matters (CustomFormatCalculationService, UpgradableSpecification,
  CutoffSpecification, …), clean-room per [../agents/legal-and-licensing.md](../agents/legal-and-licensing.md).
- **Deliberate differentiators (fix what the originals get wrong):** loud same-filesystem/hardlink
  health warning (silent copy-fallback is the #1 user footgun); never clean a library on a
  failed/empty list fetch; persist release-type to avoid season-pack re-grab loops; the decision-log
  UI (already cellarr's signature) for explainable grabs.
- **Parser long tail:** 90% exact on 120 titles is a starting point; widen the corpus toward the
  originals' ~1,500–2,000 fixtures for a trustworthy number (the never-finished tail).

---

## 7. Summary
The cellarr **engine** is real and measured (90% parser parity, working pipeline). The distance to a
true Sonarr+Radarr **drop-in** is dominated by **breadth of the `/api/v3` ecosystem surface**
(Phase A), then **wiring the existing integrations live** (Phases C–D), with **TV metadata licensing**
(Phase E) as the one external blocker requiring a product decision. None of Phases A–D are research
problems — they are well-scoped engineering against contract tests. Phase E needs a human call first.
